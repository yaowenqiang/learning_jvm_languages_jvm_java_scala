## Reasons for developing on JVM


### Java Class Library and ecosystem

+ Specific JVM version has specific classes
+ Java Class Library(SE 8)
  + Large collection of classes
  + JVM of SE 8 must implement these classes


### Java Class Library/Functionalities

+ Writting/reading from console window
+ Perform file I/O
+ TCP servers communication
+ Starting and managing OS threads
+ Defining data structures
+ Important reason for JVM popularity
+ Focused more on language design
+ incompartable and difficult to build from scrach

## Ecosystem

### Frameworks

+ Java Enterprise Edition(Java EE) (Oracle)
+ Spring framework echosystem

### Popular Application servers

open source 

+ Apache Tomcat
+ Apache TomEE
+ Red Hat WildFly
+ Orache GlassFish

per priority

+ Red Hat JBoss 
+ Oracle Weblogic


### High-level Web Application Framework

+ High-level APIs
+ Built-in model-view-controller(MVC) - enhance developer's productivity
+ Dictate or steer developer
+ Built-in support for few hardcode libraies/toolkits
+ Quick development cycles
+ Application run inside JVM application server/own HTTP server


### Microservice Framework

+ Built-in HTTP server
+ Not out-of-the-box tools for libraries
+ Easier to mix-and-match
+ Multiple standalone web services(not a requirement)
+ Most commonly used - Vert.x and Spark Java

## Popular Use cases

+ Web applications
+ Big data
+ IoT

### JVM in web applications

+ focused on performance
+ Scalable across different servers
+ Predictable
+ Debugging and profiling tools available
+ Monitoring of JVM internals possible
+ Examples - Twitter, Amazon, Spotify, and Nexflix

### Analyzing Data

+ Searching for something
+ Looking for patterns
+ Calculating statistics
+ Data can be obtained from:
  + Data collected from web servers
  + Output obtained from external sensors
  + Legacy servers

### Big Data - Popular Technologies

+ Apache Hadoop
  + Storage of data
  + Data distribution to other servers
+ Apache Spark
  + Data streaming
  + Incoming data analysis

### IoT

+ Popular and common
+ Memory-constrained systems:
  + Java ME embedded platform
  + Commercial IoT devices
+ Device sparing memory:
  + Java Se embedded edition
  + Desktop GUIs for full user interaction
