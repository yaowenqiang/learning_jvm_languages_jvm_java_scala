## Reasons for developing on JVM


### Java Class Library and ecosystem

+ Java Class Library(SE 8)
  + Large collection of classes
  + JVM of SE 8 must implement these classes


### Java Class Library/Functionalities

+ Writting/reading from console window
+ Perform file I/O
+ TCP servers communication
+ Starting and managing OS threads
+ Defining data structures
+ Important reason for JVM popularity
+ Focused more on language design
+ incompartable and difficult to build from scrach

## Ecosystem

### High-level Web Application Framework

+ High-level APIs
+ Built-in model-view-controller(MVC) - enhance developer's productivity
+ Dictate or steer developer
+ Built-in support for few hardcode libraies/toolkits
+ Quick development cycles
+ Application run inside JVM application server/own HTTP server


### Microservice Framework

+ Built-in HTTP server
+ Not out-of-the-box tools for libraries
